// In JavaScript, a prototype is an object from which other objects inherit properties and methods. Every object has a hidden internal property called [[Prototype]], which can be accessed using proto.

// For example, all string values inherit methods like toUpperCase() and slice() from String.prototype. When you access a property or method on an object, JavaScript first looks for it on the object itself, and if it doesn't find it, it looks up the prototype chain.

// In short: A prototype is a template object that other objects use to inherit shared behavior and functionality.


// console.log(typeof gameName);
// console.log(gameName.length);
// console.log(gameName.toUpperCase());   // Here, gameName is actually a String object, not a primitive string. But even though itâ€™s an object, its internal value (the string "tirthvyas") is still stored as an immutable primitive string.
